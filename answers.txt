Response to Exercise 1:

The name of the scheduling algorithm is:
Round Robin

(Exercise 2 is a coding exercise)

else if (scheduling_algorithm == 1)
	while (1) {
		for (pid = 0; pid < NPROCS; pid++)
			if (proc_array[pid].p_state == P_RUNNABLE)
				run(&proc_array[pid]);
	}

Response to Exercise 3:

Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 0:
Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 1:

Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 0:
Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 1:


Exercise 4:

Did you complete Exercise 4A, Exercise 4B, or both for extra credit?


Exercise 5:
